1) prepare virtual environment
python -m venv <name of your virtual environment>
	1.1)After installing virtual environment we have to activate it:
.\venv\Scripts\activate
	1.2)To quit virtual environment
deactivate

2)Open project in code redactor(check if the venv is workind, else  .\venv\Scripts\activate)
	2.1)Install django into your venv
pip install django
	You may see django opportunities due to (django-admin) command
	2.2)Create a project 
django-admin startproject <name of your project>

3)	RUN SERVER
	To run server first go to directory of your django-project
cd <directory to your project>
	3.1)Now we may check the server with command:
python manage.py runserver
		3.1.1) If we want to run server with another port(not "http://127.0.0.1:8000/"), after:
		python manage.py runserver <number of new port> (its not allowed to use any random numbers as it could not work)

4)Create an app:
python manage.py startapp <name of your app>
	4.1)add your app's name to settings->INSTALLED_APPS
'<name of your app>.apps.<NameConfig>'
	4.2)views.py --> write functions
from django.http import HttpResponse
def <name of func>(request):
	return HttpResponse("text")

	Then in your project folder open URLS.py and add path wich you created in views.
	*Don't forget to import neccessary file
	##http://127.0.0.1:8000/<app's name>/

	4.3)If we want to set the list of url directories from app
from django.urls import path,include

urlpatterns = [
	path('<name of prefix>/' , include('<name of app>.urls')),

]

*Create a new URLS.PY file inside app.
from django.urls import path
from .views import *

urlpatterns = [
	path('', <func name which should be requested>) #http://127.0.00.1:8000/<app's name>/
]
